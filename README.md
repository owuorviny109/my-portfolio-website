    *   AOS.js (Animate On Scroll)
    *   Chart.js (for skill visualization)

## ‚öôÔ∏è Setup & Local Development (Optional)

If you wish to run this project locally:

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/owuorviny109/my-portfolio-website.git
    cd my-portfolio-website
    ```
2.  **Open `index.html` in your browser.**
    *   Most modern browsers can open HTML files directly.
    *   For features like ES6 modules or if you set up a local server (e.g., with Live Server extension in VS Code), that's recommended.

3.  **(If using Sass)** You would need a Sass compiler to watch for changes in `.scss` files and compile them to `style.css`.
    ```bash
    # Example: npm install -g sass
    # sass --watch scss/main.scss:style.css
    ```

## üîÆ Future Enhancements (Roadmap)

*   Full integration of a blog for security articles.
*   Implementation of a Service Worker for enhanced offline capabilities.
*   More advanced WebGL-based background effects or interactive elements.
*   Refinement of the "Skills Matrix" visualization.
