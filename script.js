// Custom JavaScript for Portfolio Website

document.addEventListener("DOMContentLoaded", function () {
  // You can add more interactive features here, such as:
  // - Filtering projects by category
  // - More complex animations
  // - Contact form validation (if you implement a form)

  console.log("Portfolio script loaded.");
});

// Note: Smooth scrolling, AOS initialization, and navbar scroll behavior
// are currently handled within the <script> tags in index.html for convenience.
// For larger projects, it's often better to move all JS into this file.
